# Energy Flow Optimization

This repository provides an example of Energy Flow Optimization, where we optimize energy flows in a system consisting of a photovoltaic (PV) system, an electrical battery, a connection to the external electrical grid, and a consumer. The objective is to meet the predicted electrical energy consumption while minimizing costs.

The project is part of a technical task for an interview process with [hymate](https://www.hymate.com/). The problem statement can be found in the `instructions.pdf` file, and the data for the problem instance is in the `test_data.xlsx` file.

## Solutions

Two solutions to the problem are provided:

1. **Pyomo**: The original solution solved using [Pyomo](https://www.pyomo.org/).
2. **AMPL**: Another implementation of the solution using [AMPL](https://ampl.com/).

## Files

In the root directory, you can find the following files and directories:

- `pyomo/`: The folder containing the **Pyomo** solution.
